<p>^ Whew, that feels better. I spent so long with this pseudo-"blog" in its infancy that I had to upgrade a bunch of gems just to get Travis CI working. It's funny to pick up old projects again and realize you've been procrastinating on a relatively simple task for, uh, 1.5 years. Hey, I was busyyyy.</p>
<p>Anyway, continuous integration is an exciting thing, but I don't know that this counts since I'm not running any tests or anything; I am simply too lazy to remember to log into my server and scp things over manually. Lazy developers are the best kind, right?</p>
<p>Speaking of continuous integration, I've spoken to multiple developers lately who are marketing themselves as "full stack", but whose server experience is primarily Heroku or another cloud-based deployment thingy. Guys! I know you're always supposed to sell yourself as hard as possible to a potential employer, but Heroku is not and never will be "full stack". How is that even (apparently) up for debate?!</p>
<p>In the interest of full transparancy, I should admit that I'm extraordinarily weak on the server side. Kate, my fiancee, is a whiz with pretty much everything server related. I have googled "chown a directory" or "make a shell script executable" more times than I care to admit. ('But Elena, those are both incredible simple commands!' I KNOW.)</p>
<p>We use Linode to host all our stuff. There's a lot of really good documentation out there related to setting up a LAMP stack, a static blog like this site, hooking up your server with CI, and so on; I recommend, traitorously, Digital Ocean's documentation for things like <a href="https://digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-flask-application-on-an-ubuntu-vps">Deploying a Flask app</a>. Before moving my stuff to Linode, I spent a good 7 years on Digitalhost, inexplicably convinced that it was tooooo haaaaard to host my own stuff. Not true, it turns out. </p>
<p>I have no conclusion here. Travis good; Heroku bad (if you want to claim you can administer a server)(it's fine for other stuff)(I am not the arbiter of who is full stack! But still!).</p>
